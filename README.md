# Filter_App
Most users and learners lack a simple, intuitive tool that visually demonstrates core image 
processing operations such as filtering, edge detection, and transformations (rotation, 
translation). While OpenCV provides these functionalities programmatically, this tool bridges 
the gap with a user-friendly GUI for practical, hands-on experimentation.
The project introduces "Filter App", a desktop-centric image processing platform that supports 
various image manipulations including cartoon stylization, Gaussian blur, edge detection, 
rotation, and translation. With a foundation in Python and OpenCV, and a GUI built with Tkinter, 
the app serves as an interactive image manipulation environment for students and developers 
interested in real-time transformations.
# System Data Flow
1-User Input (Upload Image via GUI)
2-Select Operation (Cartoon, Blur, Edge, Rotate, Translate)
3-Apply Image Processing(OpenCV-based Transformation)
4-Display Result (Updated Image Shown in GUI Panel)
